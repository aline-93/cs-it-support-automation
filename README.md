# Customer Support & IT Automation Workflow

This repository showcases a real-world automation workflow I designed to improve visibility, tracking, and organization of Customer Support and IT-related activities.

The solution was built using Microsoft Power Automate and Microsoft Forms, focusing on operational efficiency rather than code-heavy development.

## 📌 Project Overview

In my daily work with Customer Success and IT Support, I needed a structured way to:

- Track customer interactions and support activities
- Log work performed without manual spreadsheets
- Generate tasks automatically for better visibility
- Provide management with clear insight into support workload

This project demonstrates how I approached that problem using automation and process design.
